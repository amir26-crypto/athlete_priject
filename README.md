# Biomechanics and Diet Analysis for Athletes

## Introduction

This project is a Python-based program designed to analyze and visualize biomechanics and diet data of athletes. The program processes biomechanics data alongside diet details to provide insights into the relationship between diet and athletic performance. It aims to help athletes, coaches, and sports scientists understand how different dietary factors influence an athlete's biomechanics, including speed, acceleration, force, and stride length. By analyzing these factors, the project allows users to explore trends, detect patterns, and make data-driven decisions to optimize performance.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Reads and processes a CSV file containing biomechanics and diet data of athletes, ensuring structured data handling.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Generates comprehensive statistical summaries of the dataset, including mean, median, standard deviation, and more, offering insights into key performance metrics.
- **Missing Value Detection:** Identifies missing values in the dataset and allows users to address data inconsistencies.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visually appealing graphs and charts that illustrate performance trends over time.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examines the relationship between diet intake (calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and biomechanics performance metrics.
- **Customizable Analysis:** Provides flexibility for users to modify data parameters and explore different aspects of the dataset.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and statistical analysis.
- **NumPy:** Facilitates numerical operations and efficient handling of large datasets.
- **Matplotlib:** Enables the creation of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** Provides high-level statistical data visualization capabilities with beautiful default themes.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   Ensure that Python and pip are installed on your system, then run the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the project file by running:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook amir.ipynb
   ```

## Sample Code

The following code snippet demonstrates the initial data loading and statistical summary:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("/content/sample_data/Md_Tanvir_Biomechanics_and_Diet_Analysis_for_Athletes.csv")

# Display statistical summary
data.describe()
```

## Sample Output

When executed, the script provides an overview of missing values in the dataset:
